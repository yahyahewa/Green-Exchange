# Green-Exchange
Welcome to GreenExchange, an innovative online platform dedicated to promoting resource conservation and sustainable living. Our website aims to create a culture of environmental responsibility by providing individuals with a convenient platform to post their unwanted items, enabling others who are in need to acquire them. Through the facilitation of material reuse, we strive to minimize waste and promote a more eco-friendly way of living.

# Features
-Item Listing: Users can post their unwanted items on the website, providing detailed description, images, and contact information.
-Item Pickup: Users can browse through available items and apply to pick them up directly on the website.
-User Account: Users must have a single account to either list items or pick them up.
-Pickup Deadline: When users apply to pick up an item, they must do so within 48 hours. If not, the transaction will be rejected, and the item will be relisted.
